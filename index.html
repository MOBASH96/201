            <h4>Planning and Production Engineer:</h4> <br>
                <p3>worked as a planning and production engineer at the"Protech" company for two months, I was responsible for the quality standards of the product, providing special reports, and making the necessary tests to inspect the commodity to achieve the highest quality standards.</p3><br>
            <h4>Designing a Bookbinding Machine:</h4> <br>
                <p3>I supervised a team to design and manufacture a bookbinding machine project in a competition in the Department of Mechanical engineering for six months at the university. And we built the machine ideally within the competition criteria. We got the first position in the competition. The work included designing the SolidWorks program, making the prototype, and then programming it.</p3>  <br>

            <h2>GRADUATE PROJECT</h2>
            <h3>Manually and automatically car robot tracking</h3>
            <p1>Car tracking with 5-DOF arm robot, it’s a prototype controlled remotely by more than one mode. These modes represent different movement track, manually, automatically (square, circle), and 5 DOF arm holding to do an activity similar to human activity.
                Dynamic equations were derivative applied to extract a kinematic pattern following a specific equation derived and then translated. These equations coded to be a program on the microcontrollers.</p1> <br>
